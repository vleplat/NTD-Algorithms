  abstract  = {In this paper we study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for non-smooth convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions for the complete class of problems. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield improved rates on problems with some degree of smoothness. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N 2) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O($\omega$ N ) for some $\omega$∈(0,1), on smooth problems. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and multi-label image segmentation.},

  abstract  = {It takes of the order of N3 operations to solve a set of N linear equations in N unknowns or to invert the corresponding coefficient matrix. When the underlying physical problem has some time- or shift-invariance properties, the coefficient matrix is of Toeplitz (or difference or convolution) type and it is known that it can be inverted with O(N2) operations. However non-Toeplitz matrices often arise even in problems with some underlying time-invariance, e.g., as inverses or products or sums of products of possibly rectangular Toeplitz matrices. These non-Toeplitz matrices should be invertible with a complexity between O(N2) and O(N3). In this paper we provide some content for this feeling by introducing the concept of displacement ranks, which serve as a measure of how ‘close’ to Toeplitz a given matrix is.},

  abstract  = {This paper revisits the problem of dictionary learning on several points although we still consider an alternating optimization scheme. Our first contribution consists in providing a simple proof of convergence for this numerical scheme for a large class of constraints and regularizers on the dictionary atoms. We also investigate the use of a well-known optimization method named alternating direction method of multipliers for solving each of the alternate step of the dictionary learning problem. We show that such an algorithm yields to several benefits. Indeed, it can be more efficient than other competing algorithms such as Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding approach and besides, it allows one to easily deal with mixed constraints or regularizers over the dictionary atoms or approximation coefficients. For instance, we have induced joint sparsity, positivity and smoothness on the dictionary atoms by means of some total variation and sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our experimental results prove that using these mixed constraints helps in achieving better learned dictionary elements especially when learning from noisy signals.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In this paper, an approach to learn a robust sparse representation dictionary for face recognition is proposed. As well known, sparse representation algorithm can effectively tackle slight occlusion problems for face recognition. However, if images are corrupted by heavy noise, performance will be not guaranteed. In this paper, to enhance the robustness of sparse representation to serious noise in face images, we integrate low rank representation into dictionary learning to alleviate the influence of unfavorable factors such as large scale noise and occlusion. Among which we extract eigenfaces by singular value decomposition (SVD) from the low rank pictures to reduce dictionary atoms and, thereby, optimize the efficiency of improved algorithm. Otherwise, we characterize each image using the histogram of orientated gradient (HOG) feature which has been proven to be an effective descriptor for face recognition in particular. The performance of the proposed Low-rank and \{HOG\} feature based \{ESRC\} (LH_ESRC) algorithm on several popular face databases such as the Extended Yale B database and CMU_PIE face database shows the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of our method by adding different proportions of randomly noise and block occlusion and real disgusts. Experimental results illustrate the benefits of our approach.},
